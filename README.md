# DeepLayr

DeepLayr is a restaking platform on Sui that enables users to re-stake Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) of both SUI and Bitcoin bridged to Sui. Inspired by EigenLayer on Ethereum, DeepLayr lets users delegate their LSTs to secure new services and protocols while earning additional rewards.

By supporting restaking of Bitcoin LSTs, DeepLayr brings BTCFi to Sui â€” enabling Bitcoin to actively participate in DeFi on a fast, scalable chain. This unlocks a new layer of yield generation, security provisioning, and capital efficiency for both SUI and BTC holders.
